Project to practise Java Principles for OCA exam.

Nik and Sam are collaborating on a project in order to practise their Java 8 skills for their upcoming OCAJP8 exams. They're aiming to make a sports simulator. This is a very generic problem, but this `README.md` will be updated as time passes!

This was found as a suggestion from a [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2a9ygh/1000_beginner_programming_projects_xpost/).
